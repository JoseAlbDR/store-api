## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**    | The codebase follows a typical server-side architecture with an Express server handling routes and interacting with a MongoDB database. Its modular structure separates concerns into different files. The provided product endpoints and database connection demonstrate good separation of concerns.                                                        |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The codebase includes useful comments in most files, providing explanations for functions and code blocks. However, comprehensive API documentation is missing, making it harder for developers to understand and use the API.                                                                                                                                |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | It relies on notable dependencies like Express for server functionality, Joi for request parameter validation, and Mongoose as the MongoDB object modeling library. These dependencies enhance the development experience and contribute to the scalability and performance of the system.                                                                    |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase is organized into separate files, splitting responsibilities such as API routes, controllers, database connections, middleware, and models. However, some codes could be further modularized by extracting reusable logic into separate functions or utility modules.                                                                            |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**         | The codebase lacks comprehensive tests. While some critical functionalities have been tested, overall coverage is minimal, with no integration tests. The addition of unit and integration tests would ensure more robust software development practices.                                                                                                     |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**    | The system's performance is dependent on external factors such as server hosting and MongoDB performance configurations. The codebase itself doesn't exhibit any significant performance concerns. However, careful optimization of database queries and server-side computations could enhance performance further.                                          |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase properly handles the most basic security concerns, such as parameter validation and error handling, preventing common vulnerabilities like injection attacks. However, more security measures, such as input sanitation and authentication/authorization, should be added to improve security.                                                   |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase is hosted on GitHub, utilizing Git for version control. While it lacks clear documentation on the specific process, branches, pull requests, and commits provide rudimentary version history. Further documentation should be added to define branching strategies and guidelines.                                                               |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The system integrates effectively with MongoDB, using the Mongoose library for data modeling and connection management. This integration allows seamless interactions with the database. Integration with external services like authentication or payment processors is not implemented in the current codebase.                                             |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The current architecture allows for horizontal scalability by adding more instances of the server behind a load balancer. Additionally, MongoDB's scalable nature supports expected future growth with appropriate database configuration. However, further optimization and structural improvements may be required as the user base and data size increase. |

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).

```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```

4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.

```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```

6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command

```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```

7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made and why they're necessary.
   The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
